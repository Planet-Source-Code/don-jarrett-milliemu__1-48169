+=======================================================+

Welcome to milliEmu, the Millipede Emulator in Visual 
Basic. I wrote this emulator because PCSloMo never really
had support for Millipede, just kind of ran it without
playing ability. So here it is, with full source. There
are still some problems, to be fixed in the next release.
A Palette is included, but you will have to wait to insert
coins. Enjoy! NOTE: DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS EMULATOR WITH ROMS
OR CHANGE A LITTLE THING IN THE SOURCE AND RE-COMPILE AND CALL
IT YOURS.

What's New?
[0.0.2]
- Well, a changed LoadRom and LoadChr, which make it a tad
bit faster.
- Frame Skip, with a selection of 1, 2, and 3. 3 is automatically
chosen at startup.
- FPS Counter, displayed on the title bar. I get about 7 FPS with a
frame skip of 2 on my P75. Please, e-mail me at r.jarrett@worldnet.att.net
and tell me what kind of performance you get. Thanks!
